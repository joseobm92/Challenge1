# <HORISEON REFACTOR>

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to apply the skills, knowledge, and tools learned on class and see how they affect the content and style of the webpage.
- I built this project with the intention of putting in practice my ability to recognize when an html file is not using semantic elements properly and fix it, while simultaneosly fixing my CSS stylesheet to work properly with the changes to make sure the webpage looked like the mockup provided.
- The code was refactored to show semantic elements, proper CSS styling elements, a descriptive title, and alt attributes on all pictures.
- What did you learn? I learned how to properly read an HTML file to understand wheter or not semantic elements are in place, on the other hand I got a better understanding on the different element types and their applications on the CSS stylesheet
